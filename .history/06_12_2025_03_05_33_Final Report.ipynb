With this goal in mind, this project analyzes individual player data to understand whether PLAI can utilize targeted outreach to maximize average data contribution. This question is addressed with the `players` data; the `sessions` data is ignored due to it's lack of player specific characteristics."

    "Our analysis showed that individual player characteristics can only weakly predict the hours logged on the PLAI Minecraft server. \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings partially matched the expectations formed during exploratory data analysis. Data contribution in the form of hours played is multifactorial and would not be able to be explained by a few variables. The GGpairs plots suggested weak linear relationships between the predictors and played hours, which is consistent with the R-squared values observed in the regression model.It was surprising that subscription status and most experience levels (Beginner, Pro, Veteran) were not significant predictors, and that age had limited explanatory power despite the apparent concentration of active players around age 20. The clustering results matched our expectation that groups of players share characteristic profiles rather than following a single global linear pattern. "
